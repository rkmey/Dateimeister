# Dateimeister
image file administration system
dateimeister allows copying and deleting of image files (photo,video) from a source location to a target location. Dateimeister generates skripts for copying / deleting files. All files are displayed on a canvas as previews. They can be displayed in full resolution as single images by double click or context menu. Files can be included or excluded. Files with identical filenames from different source subdirs which would overwrite each other, are recognized and displayed. The user can find out, which file(s) are to be kept or excluded from the copy script. Alternatively the whole subdir tree from source dir can be copied to the target dir in order to avoid duplicates. The configuration of excluded / included image files can be saved in a configuration files. Image sources like cameras can be defined. This allows specific target subdirs for image types like jpeg or video. File types (suffixes) can be defined which allows the correct display within Dateimeister previes and full resolution views. 
Dateimeister gives full control to the user who decides what happens to his image files. Their are no automatisms or hidden configuration items that lead to confusion where and how the files are copied. All actions including the copy process itself are completely undoable / redoable. Storage of configuration data is done in XML-files.
Dateimeister ist written in Python.
